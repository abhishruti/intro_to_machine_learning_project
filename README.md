Problem Statement


Project: Building Basic predictive models over the NYC Taxi Trip dataset.
You are provided with the NYC Taxi Trip Dataset. This dataset contains information about the
taxi trips that took place in different parts of New York City and how much time did that trip take
to complete.
In this project, the following are the tasks you have to complete and submit in a .zip file.:
1. Choose the most suitable evaluation metric and state why you chose it.
2. Build a benchmark model for the given dataset.
3. Build a K-Nearest neighbours model for the given dataset and find the best value of K.
4. Build a Linear model for the given dataset with regularisation. Attempt to interpret the
variable coefficients of the Linear Model.
5. Build a Decision tree model for the given dataset. Attempt to interpret the variable
importance.
6. Plot the following Barplots:
a. train score of all the above models.
b. test (not validation!) score of all the above models.
c. Attempt to explain the observations from the plots (optional)
